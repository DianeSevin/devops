##### Labeler ##########################################################################################################
# Enable "labeler" for your PR that would add labels to PRs based on the paths that are modified in the PR.
labelPRBasedOnFilePath:
  # Add 'backend' to any changes within 'api' folder or any subfolders
  backend:
    - api/**/*

  # Add 'frontend' to any file changes within 'front' folder or any subfolders
  frontend:
    - front/**/*

# Various Flags to control behaviour of the "Labeler"
labelerFlags:
  # If this flag is changed to 'false', labels would only be added when the PR is first created and not when existing
  # PR is updated.
  # The default is 'true' which means the labels would be added when PR is updated even if they were removed by the user
  labelOnPRUpdates: true
